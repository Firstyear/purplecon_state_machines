âœ¨STATE MACHINESâœ¨
==================

State machines are a way of modeling event driven systems to allow reasoning and analysis
of their behaviours and properties.

These resources and the associated presentation will be presented at PurpleCon NZ on
October 16th. Until then, this is in progress.

How to use these resources?
---------------------------

Read and follow the README - throughout we will reference the code in the various subdirectories.


These programs are all writing in Rust or C. It's not necessary to run the tests to value from this - reading the code is sufficient.

If you want to run the tests however, all examples are managed by cargo (even the C examples).
Please follow your platforms guide for "rustup" to setup a compatible environment. Once you have
Rust working, you can run the tests with:

    cargo test

The Microwave
-------------

Microwaves are a state machine, where importantly, the wrong action causes you to microwave
the poor, innocent user. We don't want that! As a result, we want to model the microwaves actions
based on what you *expect*. Let's list a few.

* If you press start and the door is open, it won't activate.
* If it's running and you open the door, it stops.
* If you press start and it's running, you add 30 seconds.
* The timer counts down, and then stops the microwave (overcooked food is also the enemy).
* And many more ...

To really get a hold of this, we need to model this state machine. What are our states?

* OPEN_NOTIME
* OPEN_TIME
* CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON
* CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON
* CLOSED_TIME_MTRON

What are our events or transitions?

* open the door
* close the door
* set time
* press stop
* press start
* one second elapses

Now we need to examine each state and what valid transitions occur. We can arrange this in a table, or draw a diagram.

    |            | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_TIME           | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON   | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON   |
    | open door  | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_TIME           | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_TIME             | OPEN_TIME           |
    | close door | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON   | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON   |
    | set time   | OPEN_TIME             | OPEN_TIME           | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON   | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON   | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON   |
    | stop       | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_NOTIME         | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON |
    | start      | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_TIME           | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON     | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON     | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON   |
    | one second | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_TIME           | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON   | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON OR CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON |

The only complexity here is second counting with the CLOSED_TIME_MTRON state - if the time reaches zero we move to "notime" otherwise, we stay in CLOSED_TIME_MTRON.

To make it a bit clearer, lets blank the rows where the same state is remained in.


    |            | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_TIME           | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON   | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON   |
    | open door  | -                     | -                   | OPEN_NOTIME           | OPEN_TIME             | OPEN_TIME           |
    | close door | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON | -                     | -                     | -                   |
    | set time   | OPEN_TIME             | -                   | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON   | -                     | -                   |
    | stop       | -                     | OPEN_NOTIME         | -                     | CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON | CLOSED_TIME_NOMTRON |
    | start      | -                     | -                   | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON     | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON     | -                   |
    | one second | -                     | -                   | -                     | -                     | CLOSED_TIME_MTRON OR CLOSED_NOTIME_NOMTRON |

That's a bit easier. Now we can see where the events will *change* our state rather that leaving us in the same state.

From this we can draw a pretty picture:

</p>

What's important is every input, at every state is *well defined* with a known safe or expected behaviour. This not only helps us to design the software
but to design a series of test cases that will exercise or stress this model to ensure it is correct.

Testing the Microwave
---------------------

With the above states above, we can now perform tests by checking the state of:

* The door
* The magnetron
* The time remaining

And by manipulating the state by the 6 transitions. You can find the test harness in `microwave_common/` to show how you can exhaustively test the state machine above.
