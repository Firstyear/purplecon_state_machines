These resources and the associated presentation will be presented at PurpleCon NZ on
October 16th. Until then, this is in progress.

How to use these resources?
---------------------------

Read and follow the README - throughout we will reference the code in the various subdirectories.


These programs are all writing in Rust or C. It's not necessary to run the tests to value from this - reading the code is sufficient.

If you want to run the tests however, all examples are managed by cargo (even the C examples).
Please follow your platforms guide for "rustup" to setup a compatible environment. Once you have
Rust working, you can run the tests with:

    cargo test
